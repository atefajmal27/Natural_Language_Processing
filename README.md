## Background
There's been a lot of hype in the news lately about cryptocurrency, so you want to take stock, so to speak, of the latest news headlines regarding Bitcoin and Ethereum to get a better feel for the current public sentiment around each coin.

## My Solution
I applied natural language processing to understand the sentiment in the latest news articles featuring Bitcoin and Ethereum. I also applied fundamental NLP techniques to better understand the other factors involved with the coin prices such as common words and phrases and organizations and entities mentioned in the articles.

### Steps to my solution:
### 1. Sentiment Analysis
Used the newsapi to pull the latest news articles for Bitcoin and Ethereum and create a DataFrame of sentiment scores for each coin.
